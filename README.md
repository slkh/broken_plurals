This repo _currently_ contains the materials used for LIN655 final project and paper.

## Contents
- `model_io` This filder contain the input and output of the WEKA model used.
- `extraxt_stuff.py` This script takes as an input a `.magold` file and uses a `calima_*_.db`analyzer to create train and test files. This script is not usable as is unless a `.magold` file and `calima-msa-s31_0.4.2.utf8.db` are available. Those files are not uploaded to this public repo due to copyright agreements.
