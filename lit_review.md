# Arabic Broken Plural Nouns: Revisited


## Quick and Dirty literature review:
### McCarthy & Prince 1990 (Foot and word in prosodic morphology: The Arabic broken plural)
They argue that the prosodic pattern is what determines the plural pattern. The conclusion is that the iambic broken plural pattern is the most productive and is the default plural pattern.

Mc&Pr take on plurals:
>Both languages [Arabic and English] organize their morphologies into a special case/general case structure, suffixing by default when the other competing inflectional modes are inapplicable, and both languages require that the input to the specialized system meet standards of canonicality, phonological (stem-shape patterns) and morphological (nonderived status).

> In Arabic the "special case" system is fully articulated and relatively few items escape it to end up with the default "sound" suffix. For the lexicon as a whole, then, broken plural formation is by far the norm rather than the exception.

Sound Plural:
>Although the term "sound plural" suggests normality - and indeed its form is entirely predictable from gender and other grammatical information - the sound plural is in no way the regular or usual mode of pluralization.

>The sound plural is systematically found only with members of the following short list: **proper names**; **transparently derived nouns or adjectives such as participles, deverbals, and diminutives** ( Levy 1971); **noncanonical or unassimilated loans (tilifuun/tilifuun+aat);** and **the names of the letters of the alphabet**, which are mostly noncanonical

Broken Plural:
>Essentially all canonically-shaped lexical nouns of Arabic take broken plurals, including many loans, even very recent ones: _film/aflaam 'film'_; _bank/bunuuk 'bank'_.

> ... we need to keep one eye on the prosodic structure of the plural patterns and the other on their actual lexical distribution ...

The focus is obviously on broken plurals.


They started by looking at the patterns of the broken plural by Wright 1971. There are four categories of plural types according to their prosodic pattern: `iambic`, `trochaic`, `monosyllabic`, and `other`.

The `other` group CvCCv(v)C is restricted. We know what goes into them, the singular form CaaCiC (`فاعِل`). Quoting Mc&Pr below:
> The most narrowlyr estrictedp lural canons are the CuCCa(a)C forms, arise only from lexicalized active participles CaaCiC these also form plurals in the iambic and trochaic patterns). Two typical examples: _kaafil/kuffal breadwinner'_; _kaafir/kuffaar 'infidel'_. Forms CuCCa(a)C account for about **30% of the masculine plurals (69/245)** from CaaCiC and virtually none of the feminines. It is therefore appropriate to posit, with McCarthy (1983), a rule limited to masculine CaaCiC that spreads the medial consonant of the singular backwards to close the first syllable, usurping its second mora. Schematically, the spreading rule changes CvvCvC to CvCCvC. The vowel melody of the singular is replaced by /u-a/ which also appears in other plurals of similar semantic classes. Unpredictably, the vowel of the second syllable is often lengthened (70% of our sample, 49/69) 

Other possible plurals for CaaCiC (`فاعِل`): _saaHir/saHar-at 'wizard'_ or _kaatib/kuttaab 'writer'_.


The `monosyllabic` plural is basically a CvCC + suffix. Quoting Mc&Pr:
>The monosyllabic plural pattern (2c), usually suffixed with _+at_, _+ay_, or _+aan_, is widespread, but at very low levels of frequency in all classes, **indicating nonproductivity**. Overall, it accounts for only **4% (95/2694)** of the triliteral broken plurals in our sample. [...] The one populatedn onsuffixingf orm, CuCC, is almost entirely limited to deverbal adjectives of color or bodily defect, a semantic class that also plays a role in the Arabic verbal system.


The `trochiac` plural CvCvC (+suffixes) is produced from the following singular forms:
>**Feminines CiCC+at and CuCC+at** form plurals CiCaC and CuCaC, respectively, about 75% of the time (138/184). Examples: _rukb +at/rukab 'knee'_, _hikm + at/hikam 'maxim'_.

>**Unsuffixed forms CvCvvC, with five distinct vocalizations**, take the trochaic pattern as the modal (commonest) plural, in the range of 50% in the large and various CaCiiC form-class (134/265) to 61% in CaCuuC (17/29). The choice among the various trochaic plural patterns of these nouns is partly determined on semantic grounds[...] Examples: _waziir/wuzar+ aa2 'vizier'_, _kitaab/kutub 'book'_, _janaab/2ajnib+at from /janib+ at/) 'wing'_.

>**The lexicalized participles CaaCiC** take the trochaic plural (CaCaC+at or CuCaC+at, depending on the phonology of the root) at a rate of 22% (54/245). This puts the `trochaic` plural about on a par with the CuCCa(a)C [`other`] form just discussed (28%, 69/245) and the `iambic` pattern CawaaCiC (26%, 65/245), with 30 nouns taking more than one of these plural patterns. Examples: _taalib/talab + at 'seeker; student'_, _saaqiy/suqay+at 'cupbearer'_.


The `iambic` pattern is the most frequent. It takes the following types of trilateral singualr patterns (different vowel shapes) (see single_stems.png for a summary):
>83% of the populous unsuffixed **monosyllabic noun class CvCC** form iambic plurals (567/681). Of the remainder, 66% have an iambic plural doublet (75/114).

>81% of simple unsuffixed **disyllables CvCvC** take iambic plurals (174/213). Of the remainder, 54% have the iambic plural as one of several options (21/39).

> 88% of **feminines CvCvvC + at** take iambic plurals (148/168) (including a predictable alternant with roots ending in a high glide). In all of the remainder the iambic plural is one option, usually in competition with the feminine sound plural. Therefore the iambic plural has complete coverage in this class.

>97% of **feminines CvvCvC + at** take iambic plurals (87/89).

There are additional 4 singular patterns:
>Furthermore, the iambic plural is important in three of the remaining four triliteral classes - CvCC+at, CvCvC+at, and CvvCvC - where it competes with the trochaic pattern. Only in the class of unsuffixed CvCvvC forms is it insignificant, at 8% (35/447)

>Finally, the iambic pattern is exclusively used for pluralization in the very large "quadriliteral" CvXCv(v)Cc lass (which includes true quadriliteral roots, bi- or triliterals with a derivational prefix, and CvvCvvC nouns). This class comprises between 1/4 and 1/3 of the nouns in our sample, with 817 members altogether.

The rest of the paper goes into detail about the phonological process of getting the `iambic` plural. The bottom line is that in the iambic plural we basically add an _infix_ mora. That infix is before the last syllable of the singular form. Additionally, that last syllable is transferred to the plural as is (modulo the vowel change).

From Mc2000 (Faithfulness and Prosodic Circumscription)
>One way to understand these facts is to regard the added μ and y as suffixes, but suffixes which are forced into infix position by high-ranking constraints (the symmetric counterparts of Tagalog and Timugon Murut in §2). The constraints responsible for infixation are members of the family of positional faithfulness constraints identified by Beckman (1995, 1997). The theory of positional faithfulness asserts that some positions are privileged to receive special faithfulness treatment. Among the positions so privileged are stem-initial and stem-final syllables. If faithfulness to stem-initial and stem-final syllables is high-ranking, then the suffixal μ or y will be driven into a stem-medial syllable. With disyllabic stems, there is no medial syllable, of course; in that case, steminitial syllable faithfulness takes precedence, following a pattern that is widely observed crosslinguistically. The point, then, is that there is a plausible affixational analysis to replace the templatic one of the operational theory.

**Takeaway**: The main argument is that the broken plural is in fact regular. As the stem undergoes a regular transformation that can be predicted within OT. This is opposed to the root-stem approach that was proposed by Hammond 1988. While this project is not carried within OT, those findings are useful nonetheless. The prosodic template can be used as an additional feature contingent upon extracting it correctly (mainly glide vs long vowel).
Additionally, I want to know how much of this is attested in ATB123, this is important because I've seen plural forms that are rarely used and other forms are preferred (e.g. the "correct" or predicted plural for jaziira is jazaa2ir, but it is almost never produce, instead the form juzur is the one used. There are is more to this discussion ... )
Mc&Pr focused on tri consonantal nominals as they argue bi and quad take a limited number of plurals.

### Dawdy-Hesterberg & Pierrehumbert 2015 (Learnability and generalisation of Arabic broken plural nouns)

Dh&Ph carried computational analysis of the noun plural in Arabic from a given corpus. They build their work using the prosodic patterns introduced by Mc&Pr, which are basically CV tempalates. They also use segmental features () and gang size (basically the frequency of the ICs in terms of CV templates.) They use generalized context model (GCM), quoting Dh&Ph on GCM:
>The GCM is conceptually similar to a k-nearestneighbours model, with two major differences: k is variable depending on gang size, and similarity to a form is modulated by similarity to all other forms. Unlike other methods such as connectionist networks, wherein hidden units and subsymbolic representations do not correspond to a specific form or process (Green, 1999; Smolensky, 1988), the GCM is highly interpretable. It is trivial to examine the mechanisms of the model by examining similarity outputs.

GCMs are basically an exmplar model, quoting Nosofsky 2011:
>According to the generalized context model (GCM) (Nosofsky, 1986), people represent categories by storing individual exemplars (or examples) in memory, and classify objects based on their similarity to these stored exemplars. For example, the model assumes that people represent the category of ‘birds’ by storing in memory the vast collection of different sparrows, robins, eagles, ostriches (and so forth) that they have experienced. If an object is sufficiently similar to some of these bird exemplars, then the person would tend to classify the object as a ‘bird’. This exemplar view of categorization contrasts dramatically with major alternative approaches that assume that people form abstract summary representations of categories, such as rules or idealized prototypes.

Dh&Ph were successful in predicting the broken plural within the group of broken plurals, however, they were still lagging behind on predicting which type of plural a single noun takes.

**Takeaway**:  Although they adopt the general connectionist approach on analogical matching to get to the plural, they didn't use a connectionist network, instead they used a more transparent model (GCM). Using the different features is nice and they were able to measure the importance of each one (CV template proved to me the most important). Additionally their results supports the finding of Mc&Pr. Some of the downsides include not using a diacritized corpus, so the templates or the gangs won't be accurate. Additionally, treating long vowels and glides as the same thing could be problematic. One other interesting finding was the ratio of broken-to-sound which didn't match that of Mc&Pr or previous efforts (Kuhlani & Habash). I need to get to the bottom of this.
